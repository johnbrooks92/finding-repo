Dory: Hello?

Sigourney Weaver: I'm Sigourney Weaver.

Dory: Oh. Hi, Sigourney. I need your help.

Sigourney Weaver: Won't you please join us...

Dory: Oh. Great, great, great.

Sigourney Weaver: As we explore the wonders of the Pacific ocean... And the amazing life it holds within.
Witness the majesty of the Beluga Whale.

Dory: Sigourney Weaver, where are you?
