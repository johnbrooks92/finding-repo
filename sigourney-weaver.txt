Sigourney Weaver: Hello.

Dory: Hello?

Sigourney Weaver: I'm Sigourney Weaver.

Dory: Oh. Hi, Sigourney. I need your help.

Sigourney Weaver: Won't you please join us...

Dory: Oh. Great, great, great.

Sigourney Weaver: As we explore the wonders of the Pacific ocean... And the amazing life it holds within.
Witness the majesty of the Beluga Whale.

Dory: Sigourney Weaver, where are you?

It is now Friday at 9am and I am using this file to practice Git functions with Samuel in our study session.

We are currently discussing the functionality of .gitignore and git pull/push/cloning.

We are now discussing the different repository functions on GitHub to link with IntelliJ. You can create .gitignore at repo setup and save a step.

You know what I might just start using this repo for notes from class and have them stored on the hub.

You can commit specific files using git add "" but it may be easier to use .gitignore to just ignore the ones you don't want and push the ones you do.
